# **TOOLS IN INFORMATION SECURITY**

- Firewalls : Control incoming and outgoing network traffic
- Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) : Monitor for and block suspicious activities
- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems : Collect and analyze security event data
- Vulnerability scanners : Identify potential weaknesses in systems and applications
- Penetration testing tools : Simulate attacks to find vulnerabilities (e.g., Metasploit, Burp Suite)
- Encryption tools : Protect data confidentiality and integrity
- Access control systems : Manage user permissions and authentication
- Security awareness training platforms : Educate users about security best practices

# NETWORK SECURITY

## Firewalls:

- Act as barriers between trusted internal networks and untrusted external networks, filtering traffic based on predetermined security rules.

## Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):

- Monitor network traffic for suspicious activities and take automated actions to detect or block potential threats

## Virtual Private Network (VPN):

- Provide secure, encrypted connections over public networks, ensuring data privacy and integrity during transmission. For example, used by employees to connect to internal network resources.

## Acces Control Mechanism:

- Include authentication and authorization protocols to ensure only legitimate users can access network resources.

## Encryption Technologies:

- Protect sensitive data both in transit and at rest, rendering it unreadable to unauthorized parties.

# WHAT IS DISTRIBUTED DENIAL OF SERVICE (DDoS)

- This means making a computer, server, or website unavailable to real users by overwhelming it with too much traffic (like too many requests at once).

## How It Works?

- Attacker controls a botnet.
- Orders all these machines to send massive amounts of requests or data to the target (like a website)
- The target system becomes overloaded and cannot respond to real users
- Legitimate users experience slowdowns, errors, or the site goes completely offline

## What is the difference between ddos and dos attack?

- in dos attack one device is sending too much request to a server,computer or website and trying to make it slow down or crash
- in ddos attack much more device is trying to do same thing

# WHAT IS RANSOMWARE?

- A type of malware that **encrypts or locks your files/system** and then **demands payment (ransom)**, usually in cryptocurrency, to restore access.

# WHAT IS SOCIAL ENGINEERING?

- It doesn’t matter how robust your system.Social engieering is interesting with human psychology.they are not trying to hack systems they are trying to hack the persons so they dont need to hack complex systems.
- A manipulation technique where attackers **exploit human psychology** (trust, fear, curiosity) to trick people into **revealing information, giving access, or performing actions** that compromise security.

## The Techniques

- Phishing
- Pretexting
- Baiting
- Tailgating
- Quid Pro Quo

## PHISHING

- Phishing is one of the most common social engineering techniques. Attackers send deceptive emails or messages that appear to come from legitimate sources to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information like usernames, passwords, or credit card numbers

## PRETEXTİNG

- A type of social engineering attack where the attacker **creates a fake scenario (pretext)** to trick the victim into giving sensitive information or access. The attacker usually pretends to be someone trustworthy (like a bank employee, IT support, or manager).

## BAITING

- Imagine finding a USB drive labeled "Employee Salaries 2023" in the office parking lot. Curiosity piqued, you plug it into your computer to see what's on it. Unknown to you, the drive installs malware on your system. Baiting uses the promise of something enticing to lure victims into a trap.

## TAILGATING

- Suppose you're entering a secure building that requires a keycard. An individual carrying a large box approaches and asks you to hold the door because they can't reach their card. Being polite, you let them in, unknowingly allowing unauthorized access. Tailgating involves an attacker following an authorized person into a restricted area without proper credentials.

## QUİD PRO QUO

- Imagine receiving a call from someone offering a free software upgrade in exchange for your login details. They promise the upgrade will improve your computer's performance. Quid pro quo attacks offer a benefit in exchange for information or access.

# WHAT IS ADVANCED PERSISTENT THREAT (APT)?

- A long-term, targeted cyberattack where attackers **gain unauthorized access** to a network, stay hidden for a long time, and **steal sensitive data**.
