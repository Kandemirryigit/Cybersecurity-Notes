# Exploit Vulnerabilities

# Automated Vulnerability Research

## Definition:

- Automated vulnerability research uses **tools and scanners** to automatically detect security weaknesses in systems, applications, or networks

## How It Works:

- Tools scan the target
- Compare results with known vulnerability databases (CVE, NVD, etc.)
- Produce reports automatically

## Examples of tools:

- Nessus
- OpenVAS
- Nmap (with NSE scripts)
- Burp Suite Scanner
- Nikto

## Advantages:

- Fast and scalable
- Can scan large systems easily
- Good for finding **known vulnerabilities**
- Requires less deep technical knowledge

## Disadvantages:

- Cannot understand application logic well
- Often produces **false positives**
- Misses **custom or zero-day vulnerabilities**
- Depends on signatures and databases

## Best used when:

- Initial security assessment
- Large environments
- Time is limited

# Manual Vulnerability Research

## Definition:

- Manual vulnerability research is done by a **human researcher** who analyzes the system by hand to find security flaws.

## How it works:

- Reading source code or reversing binaries
- Understanding application logic
- Manually testing inputs and behaviors
- Thinking like an attacker

## Examples of techniques:

- Code review
- Reverse engineering (Ghidra, IDA)
- Manual web testing (Burp Repeater)
- Fuzzing with custom payloads
- Logic flaw discovery

## Advantages:

- Finds **logic flaws**
- Can discover **zero-day vulnerabilities**
- Very accurate
- Deep understanding of the target

## Disadvantages:

- Time-consuming
- Requires strong technical skills
- Not scalable for large systems
- Depends heavily on researcher experience

## Best used when:

- High-value targets
- Advanced security testing
- Research and bug bounty work

# Security Misconfigurations

## Definition:

- **Security Misconfiguration** occurs when a system, application, or service is **not securely configured**, leaving it exposed to attacks.
- It is one of the **OWASP Top 10** vulnerabilities.

## Why Security Misconfigurations Happen

- Using **default settings**
- Weak or missing security controls
- Unnecessary features enabled
- Poor system hardening
- Lack of regular updates and audits
- Human error

## Common Examples:

### a.)Default Credentials

- Using `admin/admin`
- Not changing router, database, or admin panel passwords

**Risk:**

- Attackers can easily log in.

### b.)Unnecessary Services Enabled

- FTP, Telnet, or debug services running
- Test APIs left active in production

**Risk:**

- Increases the attack surface.

### c.)Exposed Admin Interfaces

- Admin panels accessible from the internet
- No IP restriction or authentication

**Risk:**

- Brute-force or privilege escalation attacks.

### d.)Improper File & Directory Permissions

- Sensitive files readable by everyone
- Writable configuration files

**Risk:**

- Information disclosure or system compromise.

### e.)Verbose Error Messages

- Stack traces shown to users
- Detailed server error responses

**Risk:**

- Leaks system and application details.

### f.)Missing Security Headers

- No `Content-Security-Policy`
- No `X-Frame-Options`

**Risk:**

Enables XSS, clickjacking, and other attacks.

### g.)Outdated Software

- Old web servers, frameworks, libraries

**Risk:**

- Known vulnerabilities can be exploited.

## **Impact of Security Misconfigurations**

- Data breaches
- Unauthorized access
- System takeover
- Privilege escalation
- Compliance violations

## How to Detect Security Misconfigurations

**Automated Methods:**

- Nessus, OpenVAS
- Nmap scripts
- Cloud security scanners

**Manual Methods:**

- Checking configuration files
- Reviewing permissions
- Manual endpoint testing
- Reading server responses

# Broken Access Control

## Definition:

- **Broken Access Control** occurs when an application **fails to properly enforce what users are allowed to do**, allowing attackers to access data or perform actions **outside their permissions**.
- It is **OWASP Top 10 #1** (very critical).

## What Access Control Means:

Access control defines:

- **Who** can access a resource
- **What** actions they can perform
- **Which** data they are allowed to see

Types:

- **Authentication** → Who you are
- **Authorization** → What you can do
- Broken access control is an authorization problem, not authentication.

## Common Causes:

- Missing permission checks
- Client-side access control (trusting frontend)
- Insecure direct object references (IDOR)
- Misconfigured roles
- Hardcoded or predictable IDs
- Over-privileged users

## Common Examples:

### a.)Insecure Direct Object Referance (IDOR)

- User changes an ID in the URL:
- /profile?user_id=1001
- to
- /profile?user_id=1002
- and sees another user’s data.
- **Risk:** Data leakage.

### b.)Privilege Escalation

- A normal user accesses:
- /admin/dashboard
- without being an admin.
- **Risk:** Full system control.

### c.)Missing Function-Level Access Control

- Backend does not check permissions for sensitive actions:
- Deleting users
- Changing roles
- Viewing logs
- **Risk:** Unauthorized actions.

## Real-World Scenarios

- Viewing other users’ invoices
- Editing someone else’s profile
- Accessing admin APIs
- Downloading private files

## Impact

- Unauthorized data access
- Data modification or deletion
- Account takeover
- Full system compromise

## How to Detect Broken Access Control

**Manual:**

- Change IDs in requests
- Access restricted endpoints
- Modify request parameters
- Test role-based actions

**Automated:**

- Burp Suite Scanner
- OWASP ZAP
- Custom test scripts

# Insecure Deserialization

## Definition:

- **Insecure Deserialization** occurs when an application **deserializes untrusted user input** without proper validation, allowing attackers to manipulate serialized data and execute **unauthorized actions or code**.
- It was **OWASP Top 10 (A8:2017)** and is now included under **Software & Data Integrity Failures**.

## What Is Serialization & Deserialization?

**Serialization**: Converting an object into a format for storage or transmission

- Examples: JSON, XML, Binary, Base64
- **Deserialization**: Rebuilding the object from serialized data

## Why Insecure Deserialization Is Dangerous

- The application **trusts user-controlled data**
- Attackers can **modify object properties**
- Can lead to:
    - Privilege escalation
    - Authentication bypass
    - Remote Code Execution (RCE)
    

## Common Attack Examples

### a.)Privilege Escalation

- Serialized object:
- {"user":"yeet","isAdmin":false}
- Attacker changes it to:
- {"user":"yeet","isAdmin":true}
- **Result:** Admin access.

### b.)Authentication Bypass

- Session data stored in a cookie:
- {"loggedIn":false}
- Attacker changes it to:
- {"loggedIn":true}

### c.)Object Injection

Attacker injects malicious objects that trigger:

- File deletion
- Command execution
- Database manipulation

## How to Detect Insecure Deserialization

**Manual:**

- Identify serialized data (Base64, binary, JSON)
- Modify values and resend requests
- Observe changes in behavior

**Automated:**

- Burp Suite Scanner
- Custom fuzzing
- Gadget chain detection tools

## Impact

- Account takeover
- Privilege escalation
- Data manipulation
- Remote code execution

# Injection

## Definition:

- **Injection** occurs when **untrusted user input** is sent to an interpreter (SQL, OS, LDAP, etc.) and is **executed as part of a command or query**.
- Injection is a core OWASP Top 10 vulnerability.

## Why Injection Happens

- User input is **not validated**
- No input sanitization or escaping
- Dynamic query or command construction
- Application trusts user-controlled data

## Common Types of Injection

### a.)SQL Injection (SQLi)

- Attacker injects SQL code into a database query.

**Impact:**

- Database dump
- Authentication bypass
- Data modification/deletion

### b.)Command Injection (OS Injection)

- Attacker injects system commands.

**Impact:**

- Remote command execution
- Server takeover

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

- Attacker injects JavaScript into web pages.

**Impact:**

- Session hijacking
- User impersonation

### LDAP Injection

- Attacker manipulates LDAP queries.

**Impact:**

- Authentication bypass
- Data disclosure

### XPath Injection

- Injection into XML queries.

**Impact:**

- Unauthorized data access

## How Injection Attacks Work

- Application accepts user input
- Input is inserted into a command/query
- Interpreter executes malicious input
- Attacker controls application behavior

## Impact of Injection

- Data breaches
- Full system compromise
- Account takeover
- Data corruption or deletion

## How to Prevent Injection

- Use **parameterized queries**
- Input validation and sanitization
- Escape user input
- Use safe APIs
- Least privilege for databases
- Avoid dynamic command execution
